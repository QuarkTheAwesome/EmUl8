# EmUl8
A foray into emulation on the PowerPC. Names will change once I decide exactly what to emulate ;D

The demo is not a demo, it's the program I use to make sure this isn't going to spontaneously combust your PowerPC

### Current Project Status
(2017-11-09) This isn't going anywhere, archviving. This one sorta fell over once RetroArch came along and blew any emulation projects out of the water. If you want to emulate stuff; use it instead ([link](https://gbatemp.net/threads/447670/)). If you're here for, like, history or something... why?
